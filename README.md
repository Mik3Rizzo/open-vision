# Open Vision

*Open Vision* is an open-source software designed for home-based vision training, with a specific focus on fusional vergence deficit.

The software requires red-blue anaglyph glasses and offers targeted exercises to stimulate and strengthen fusional vergence: the visual systemâ€™s ability to maintain single binocular vision by dynamically adjusting eye alignment to compensate for small deviations.

**Disclaimer:** *Open Vision is not medical software and does not replace professional medical advice. It is based on my personal experience as a patient, replicating exercises performed with professional software under the supervision of an orthoptist in a clinical setting. Use at your own risk.*
